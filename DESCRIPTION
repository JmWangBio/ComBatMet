Description: ComBatMet is a regression framework to adjust batch effects in DNA methylation studies. 
    This package includes three batch correction methods. ComBat-met fits beta regression models to the 
    beta-values, calculates batch-free distributions, and maps the quantiles of the estimated distributions 
    to their batch-free counterparts. M-value ComBat log-transforms beta values to M-values prior to applying batch
    correction via ComBat. ComBat-biseq fits beta-binomial regression models to the bisulfite sequencing data 
    followed by a batch correction procedure similar to ComBat-met.
